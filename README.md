1.Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree

.Use DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn.

.Fit the model to your dataset.

.Visualize the tree using export_graphviz or plot_tree.

2.Analyze overfitting and control tree depth

.Train the decision tree with different max_depth values.

.Evaluate model accuracy using cross-validation.

.Identify the depth at which overfitting starts and choose an optimal depth.

3.Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy

.Use RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn.

.Train the model and predict results.

.Compare accuracy with the single decision tree to see improvement.

4Interpret feature importances

.Use .feature_importances_ from the Random Forest model.

.Visualize the most important features using a bar chart.

.Understand which features impact predictions the most.

5.Evaluate using cross-validation

.Apply cross_val_score with 5 or 10 folds.

.Get the average accuracy to assess generalization.

.Use this to compare the reliability of decision tree vs. random forest.
